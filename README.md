This is a simple simulation program written in HTML and Javascript; It was done for the class "Engineering 307 (Mechanics of Materials Lab)" as a final project. It simulates a massive object suspended, and swinging, from an extensible cable that obeys the laws of Stress vs. Strain for a simply elastic material (such as the elastic regime of steel).
