This is a simple simulation program written in HTML and Javascript; It was done for the class "Engineering 307 (Mechanics of Materials Lab)" as a final project. It simulates a massive object suspended, and swinging, from an extensible cable that obeys the laws of Stress vs. Strain for a simply elastic material (such as the elastic regime of steel).

This project is not as polished as I would like it to be but it was enough to pass the class. It's not that important to me anymore because I'm no longer an engineering student, but I thought I'd keep it around for fun.
